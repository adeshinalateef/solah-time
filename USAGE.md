Salat Flyer Usage (quick guide)

- Upload your masjid logo or paste a public image URL in the **Logo** field.
- Enter **Masjid / Location** name and **Address**.
- Fill **Uploader Name** and **Uploader Phone** (both required) and set **Last Updated** (use the datetime picker) — the uploader name and phone will be shown on the flyer and are required to download the image.
- Enter all prayer times manually. Optionally set Jumu'ah second time and choose whether to show Shuruq.
- Use the **Theme** controls to pick a color, then click **Download PNG** to get a 1080x1350 image ready to share on WhatsApp.
